Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their customers. Artemis financial wanted to modernize it's operations, and in order to do so wanted to implement the latest software security. This included assessing their software for vulnerabilities.


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I did particularly well with determining an effective algroithmic cipher for the company to make use of. It is important to code securely in order to prevent private data from leaking to bad actors and to help the code continue to function properly. Software security helps mitigate the potential for bad actors to steal data or compromise their code. This reduces the risk a company has from their digital operations and builds trust with their customers.


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

When working through the vulnerability assessment, I found the manual code review to be helpful. By reviewing the code we gain a better understanding of how it functions. This also allows to identify potential areas of weakness in the code that could be exploited.


How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

To increase layers of security, we had to ensure that the company was making use of the latest released versions of the software they were making use of. This eliminates most of the known vulnerabilities. Also incorporating an algorithmic cipher was a huge step in ensuring the company's communications and data storage would be secure. In the future, it would be ideal to build security into the code from the start of the project. But when assessing vulnerabilities in the future, the first place to start would be ensuring everything is up to date and proceeding from there.


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The code and software application were updated to make use of the latest versions of the software being used. The code was reviewed for vulnerabilities and potential issues. And an algorithm was introduced to help secure the software. After refactoring was complete, we checked for new vulnerabilities through the depency check and manually reviewing the code for any additional problems after the changes were made.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

One of the most important tools is being able to research vulnerabilities once discovered. Making use of a search engine and knowing which sources are more helpful can assist in handling vulnerabilities you are not familiar with. 


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

In this particular assignment, I was proud of my work on the algorithmic cipher and would like to showcase this to a future employer.
